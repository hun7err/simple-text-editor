simple-text-editor
==================

Simple Text Editor, abbreviated STE, is a text editor with syntax highlighting written by Krzysztof 'hun7er' Marciniak and Michał Bartecki for OOP classes at Poznań University of Technology. Because of small time window for writing it (exams and other things), we decided to use RSyntaxTextArea (a wonderful thing, really!) with Insubstantial LookAndFeel for Swing to make it look and work nice while spending less time on coding.
If possible, please don't look at WindowActionHandler. Really. It's the worst part of the project because we didn't have enough time to separate those lines putting them in special functions (like ListActionHandler); nethertheless, it seems to work as expected so there's probably nothing to complain about.
In latest commit (while I'm writing it) I've added some screenshots. Enjoy!
